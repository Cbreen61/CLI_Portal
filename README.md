# PortalGun

Welcome to Ricks Portal gun, I developed this gem as part of my Flatiron School Project. I developed this gem to help users find more information about the Rick and Morty show. This gem uses the Rick and Morty API to show lists and detials about characters and locations.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'portal_gun'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install portal_gun

## Usage

Execute the '.bin/run' file. You will then be prompted to choose to browse Location by entering 'L' or Characters entering 'C'. From there you'll see a list of either option and then can select further details by entering the number associated with your choice.

## Development

 Run `bin/run` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
